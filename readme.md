# 🌿 AgroVITa : Innovation meets farming

Welcome to **AgroVITa**! This repository hosts a full-stack web application, built with a robust Java backend and a dynamic frontend utilizing modern web technologies. While specific functionalities aren't detailed within the repository, the project is designed as a comprehensive solution, likely targeting the agricultural sector given its name, by providing both server-side logic and an interactive user interface.

---

### ✨ Features (Assumed)

* **User Interface:** Interactive and responsive design for an engaging user experience.
* **Backend Logic:** Robust server-side processing for data management and business logic using Java.
* **Modular Development:** Separation of concerns between frontend and backend components.
* **Modern Styling:** Utilizes a utility-first CSS framework for efficient styling.
* **Scalable Architecture:** Designed with components that allow for future expansion and growth.

---

### 💻 Technologies Used

* **Backend:**
    * **Java:** The primary language for server-side development.
    * **Maven:** For project build automation and dependency management (`pom.xml`).
    * **Spring Boot (Assumed):** A common framework for building stand-alone, production-ready Java applications, often used with Maven.
* **Frontend:**
    * **HTML:** For structuring web content.
    * **CSS:** For styling, leveraging [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for utility-first styling (`tailwind.config.js`).
    * **JavaScript:** For interactive elements and dynamic behaviors.
    * **Node.js / npm/yarn (Assumed):** For managing frontend dependencies and potentially running build scripts (indicated by `package.json` and `package-lock.json`).

### 📂 Project Structure

The project is structured to organize both frontend and backend components:

* `src/`: Contains the main source code for the application. This directory will typically house:
    * Java source files for the backend logic.
    * HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the frontend.
    * Potentially static assets like images, fonts, etc.
* `package-lock.json`, `package.json`: Configuration files for Node.js package management, defining frontend dependencies and scripts.
* `pom.xml`: The Maven Project Object Model file, detailing Java dependencies, build processes, and project metadata for the backend.
* `tailwind.config.js`: The configuration file for Tailwind CSS, customizing its utility classes for the frontend.

### ⚙️ Setup and Run

To set up and run AgroVITa locally, you'll need both **Java (JDK)** and **Node.js** installed on your system.

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Anubhav2912/AgroVITa.git](https://github.com/Barisha1402/Agrovita.git)
    cd AgroVITa
    ```
2.  **Install Frontend Dependencies:**
    Navigate to the project root and install the Node.js packages required for the frontend and Tailwind CSS:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or if you use yarn:
    # yarn install
    ```
3.  **Build the Project:**
    Use Maven to build the Java backend. This step might also trigger frontend build processes defined in `pom.xml` or `package.json` that compile Tailwind CSS, bundle JavaScript, etc.
    ```bash
    # Ensure Maven is installed or use its wrapper if available
    mvn clean install
    ```
4.  **Run the Application:**
    After a successful build, you can typically run the Java backend application (assuming it's a Spring Boot application) from the target directory:
    ```bash
    java -jar target/<your-application-jar-name>.jar
    ```
    Alternatively, you can import the project into your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) and run the main Spring Boot application class directly.

    Once the backend is running, the frontend will likely be accessible via a web browser at a specific port (e.g., `http://localhost:8080`), depending on your Spring Boot configuration.
